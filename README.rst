UEA Time Series Classification - CAWPE-Folds Stable Branch
===============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/goastler/uea-tsc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/goastler/uea-tsc)

This is a stable branch in support of the paper 'Mixing hetero- and homogeneous models in weighted ensembles'. It is intended to provde a snapshot of the code at the time of submission, as well as a stable location for summaries of results. See the associated [website](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/CAWPEFolds.php) for more details. 

Supplementary Material
------------

Results summaries can be found at [CAWPEResults/](https://github.com/TonyBagnall/uea-tsc/tree/paper/cawpeExtension/Results).

Algorithmic code can be found in [src/main/java/CawpeExtensionPaper/CAWPE_Extended.java](https://github.com/TonyBagnall/uea-tsc/blob/paper/cawpeExtension/src/main/java/CawpeExtensionPaper/CAWPE_Extended.java). 

Experimental setup code can be found in [src/main/java/CawpeExtensionPaper/CAWPEClassifierList.java](https://github.com/TonyBagnall/uea-tsc/blob/paper/cawpeExtension/src/main/java/CawpeExtensionPaper/CAWPEClassifierList.java). 

Code for using our analysis pipeline (constantly being updated) in order to produce the results for the paper is in [src/main/java/CawpeExtensionPaper/CAWPEAnalysis.java](https://github.com/TonyBagnall/uea-tsc/blob/paper/cawpeExtension/src/main/java/CawpeExtensionPaper/CAWPEAnalysis.java).
